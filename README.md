# IPL Data Analysis

## Overview

This project performs data analysis on the IPL 2022 Auction data to derive insights and form the best playing XI based on various performance metrics. The dataset includes details of players sold in the IPL 2022 auction and retained players, covering attributes such as matches played, runs, wickets, averages, strike rates, and fielding stats.

## Objectives

- Understand the IPL auction data and its structure.

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.

- Analyze key performance metrics for players.

- Visualize statistical insights using data visualization techniques.

- Determine the best playing XI based on squad formation principles from past winning teams.

## Dataset

The dataset includes:

- Player statistics (matches, runs, wickets, averages, strike rates, etc.)

- Player roles (batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, wicket-keepers)

- Franchise retention and auction purchases

## Analysis Steps

1. Data Extraction & Loading: Load and explore the dataset.

2. Data Cleaning: Remove inconsistencies and handle missing values.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends and key statistics.

4. Data Visualization: Use charts and graphs for better insights.

5. Best XI Selection: Formulate an optimal playing XI based on performance data and past squad formations.

## Technologies Used

Python

- Pandas & NumPy (Data manipulation and analysis)

- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)

- Jupyter Notebook (Interactive analysis)

## Results

- Statistical insights into player performance

- Data-driven approach to selecting the best IPL XI

- Visualisation of key findings for better decision-making
